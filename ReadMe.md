# Rob Hague's ZMK Configs

This repository contains [Rob Hague](https://rob.rho.org.uk/about)'s [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) configurations for his various [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) keyboard builds.

## Manta

For a full description of this keyboard, see [here](https://rob.rho.org.uk/2022/05/oops_i_did_it_again.html). As far as I'm aware, the combination of the Manta board with a nice!nano doesn't appear elsewhere.

## Ferris Sweep (MBUK)

This configuration covers the [Mechboards UK](https://mechboards.co.uk/products/ferris-sweep-kit?variant=41437490544845) version of the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) (Choc spacing). It's based on [this configuration](https://github.com/flunderpero/ferris-zmk/tree/main) from [flunderpero](https://github.com/flunderpero).
